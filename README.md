Heey beautiful campers from Batch 880! 🤓


Here you can find all the classes from our classes together on Cookbook, Food Delivery and Js Week.

Remember, you don't need to keep navegation through this folders on github. You can instead:
  - simply press the '.' key on your keyboard to open a VS Code enviroment in your browser with the code
  - clone the repo in you terminal running `git clone git@github.com:lucasevero/batch-880.git`

If you don't want to lose the updates of the repo you can star it; ⭐

Or just keep running `git pull origin master` in your cloned directory after classes so you can fetch new code 😉
